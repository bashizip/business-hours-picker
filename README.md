## Installation 

Step 1 : Add jitpack to your build.gradle file

	
	
	allprojects {
		repositories {
			...
			maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
		}
	}
	

  
  Step 2 : Add the dependency
  

  
 	implementation 'com.github.bashizip:business-hours-picker:v1.0.0-beta.2'

   
  ## How to use it 
  
   
First  Add the picker and the viewer you want to use in your layout files. The library has 4 main components,
2 Pickers and 2 viewer respectively :

**BusinessHoursPicker**

 Use it to pick a single business day
 

```xml
    <com.bashizip.bhlib.BusinessHoursPicker
        app:dayOfWeek="Monday"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"/>
```

        
  **BusinessHoursWeekView**
  
  Use it to pick a full week of business days from monday to sunday
  
 ```xml
	   <com.bashizip.bhlib.BusinessHoursWeekView
		android:id="@+id/bh_view"
		android:layout_width="match_parent"
	      android:layout_height="wrap_content"/>
```

   **BusinessHoursView**
    
   Use it to display a single business day
   
 ```xml
     <com.bashizip.bhlib.BusinessHourView
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"/>
```

**BusinessHoursWeekView**
     
   Use it to display a full week of business days 
   
 ```xml
    <com.bashizip.bhlib.BusinessHoursWeekView
        android:id="@+id/bh_view"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"/>
 ``` 
     
  Then in your java code :
  
  **The picker activity of fragment**
  
```java
	  BusinessHoursWeekPicker bh_picker = findViewById(R.id.bh_picker);
	  Button btn_apply = findViewById(R.id.btn_apply);
	     btn_apply.setOnClickListener(view -> {
	     
		   List<BusinessHours> bhs = bh_picker.getBusinessHoursList();

		   // Here do your stuffs with the list

		});
 ```	
	
        
   **The viewer activity or fragment**
   
  ```java
        List<BusinessHours> businessHoursList = getList();
       
       // Just call the setModel method and it's done !
       businessHoursWeekView.setModel(businessHoursList);
 ```


See the full sample app for more details.
